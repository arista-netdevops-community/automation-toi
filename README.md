# Automation Transfer of Information

This TOI will walk you through the different steps to automate the creation of a VXLAN-EVPN fabric composed of 2 pods that will share a common underlay and a single EVPN domain as well as the EVPN services and host attachments.

We will use two approaches to achieve the same goal: Arista CloudVision Studios and Arista Validated Design.

A pod is a set of spines and the leafs connecting each other.
The 2 pods are interconnected with one link between `s1-brdr1` and `s2-brdr1` and another link between `s1-brdr2` and `s2-brdr2`.
